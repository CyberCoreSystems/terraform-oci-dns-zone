# DNS Zone & Traffic Steering

Public/private DNS zones with record sets, failover/geo steering policies and health-check probes.

This module passes static validation (`tofu validate`, tflint and checkov) but has not yet been applied to a live account.

## Usage

```hcl
module "dns_zone" {
  source  = "CyberCoreSystems/dns-zone/oci"
  version = "~> 1.0"

  # See variables.tf for the full input contract.
}
```

## Why this module

Every module we publish goes through the same gate before release:

| check | what it means |
|---|---|
| `tofu validate` + `tflint` | it parses and lints clean |
| `checkov` | scanned for insecure defaults |
| **live test** | **really applied to a cloud account, outputs verified, then destroyed** |

That last row is the one most module catalogues skip. A module that has never
been applied has never been proven.

## Provider compatibility

```
oci >= 8.0, < 9.0
```
